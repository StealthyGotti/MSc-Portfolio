# Mathematical Models and Methods for Image Processing

This repository contains assignments and code implementations for the "Mathematical Models and Methods for Image Processing" course.

## 🎯 Course Goals
* The primary goal is to design, implement, and practice algorithms based on simple mathematical models from linear algebra and convex optimization.
* These methods are used to solve challenging inverse problems in image processing, including denoising, deblurring, inpainting, and anomaly detection.
* A core focus is understanding sparse representations and sparsity as a form of regularization in learning problems.
